# What is zeroGPT API 

The ZeroGPT API, also known as chatGPT detector, is an API designed to detect whether a given text has been generated by a GPT language model or written by a human. It utilizes various natural language processing techniques to analyze the text and identify patterns and characteristics that are indicative of GPT-generated content. The API can be integrated into various applications and systems to help identify and filter out potentially misleading or malicious content generated by GPT models.

ZeroGPT API or chatGPT detector is an AI-based technology that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze text-based conversations and detect potential instances of inappropriate or harmful content. This API is designed to be integrated into various chat platforms, social media applications, or other digital communication tools to provide real-time content moderation and enhance user safety.

  },
  data: {
    input_text: 'C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language...'
  }
};

try {
  const response = await axios.request(options);
  console.log(response.data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
````
### PHP (cURL)
